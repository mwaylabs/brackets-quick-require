For example you can use it to deliver continuously new versions of your files. You can also use it for lazy loading.\n\n##How it works\nThe usage is quit simple. You simply call the update-manager with a config object which contains a `extractPath` and a URL to a `version.json`.\n\nEverytime the update-manager is called, he compares the local version and the remote version. If the remote version is greater than the local, the download starts automatically.\n\n###Installation\n\n`npm install update-manager`\n\n###The version file\n\n    {\n        \"version\": \"1.1.1\",\n        \"updateURL\": \"http://example.com/path/to/your/files.zip\"\n    }\n\n###How to use\n\n    var updateManager = require('update-manager');\n    \n    var config = {\n        updateVersionURL: 'http://example.com/path/to/your/version.json',\n        extractPath: 'global/path/to/your/dest'\n    }\n    \n    // everytime init() is called, the update-manager looks for a new available version\n    function init() {\n        updateManager.update(config);\n    }\n\n##Licence\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2014 M-Way Solutions GmbH.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
